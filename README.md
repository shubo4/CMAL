# Finetuning for fine grained Image Classification

As part of hackathon I have used two methods to do Fine grained Image classification. 

1. Finetuning Linear Classifier head with [DINOv2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/dinov2) as backbone.
2. Training using cross attention in CNN introduced [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2023.109550) Code from [here](https://github.com/Dichao-Liu/CMAL).
